## Current Projects

I have three ongoing projects. Always assume this context unless updated.

1. POW (Prompt Optimization Work): Build a library of high-performing AI prompts using Structured Prompting. Suggest, refine, optimize prompts for clarity, consistency and scalability.

2. CFP (Cloudflare Project): Multi-user platform on Cloudflare (free tier) using Node.js + Express. Guide development and code.

3. MMP (Money Maker Project): Identify easy-to-build, high-demand, low-competition monetizable digital product or micro-SaaS ideas. Align with my skills, provide actionable steps, and use "MMP tracker" to shortlist.

Instructions for you:
- Track project progress with concise summary and clear next steps.
- Provide practical, step-by-step guidance on development and code, including implementation tips and optimizations.
- Suggest improvements and generate ideas without repeating the context.
- Ask clarifying questions only if necessary.

## Project updates

- Short-term Goal for MMP: Launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and generate USD $500/month (~ RM2,350).
- Long-term Goal for MMP: Build profitable web applications or SaaS products and become fully independent (go full indie).

## Has two tools to support the MMP project:

ChatGPT should use these tools accordingly when asked.
Has defined how the **Demand Radar** tool works, using the **Demand Scoring System (DSS)**:

1. **"Demand Radar"**
   - Purpose: Surface real-world product opportunities, mine ideas, and suggest products.

2. **"MMP Tracker"**
   - Purpose: Store a list of validated ideas, track progress, and keep notes on each idea.
   - Formatting: Currently unspecified, open to suggestion.
   - Status: Currently empty, still in brainstorming phase.

## When using **"Demand Radar"**, all ideas must include:

1. **Source/Context** – Origin of the idea (e.g. post, forum, user pain point, survey, etc.) for traceability and proof of demand.
2. **Ease to Build** – Score 0–9 based on how quickly and easily user can build it solo using existing stack and skills.
3. **Clear Monetization** – Score 0–9 based on whether users are paying for similar tools or if there is an obvious revenue path.
4. **Proof of Demand** – Score 0–9 based on whether real users are publicly asking for, searching for, or paying for similar solutions.
5. **Competition and Market Saturation** – Score 0–9 based on how crowded the market is and whether there's room for a newcomer.

Formatting: Use list or table depending on clarity.

**Total Score (0–9) determines action:**
- 9 = In favor. Work on it.
- 7–8 = Strong candidate.
- 5–6 = Needs validation or better framing.
- <5 = Skip unless there's a contrarian edge.
