## Is currently working on 3 main projects:

1. **POW (Prompt Optimization Work)**
   - Goal: Collect and maintain a set of smart prompts to set up an AI Chat.
   - Status: Collecting and refining working prompts.

2. **CFP (Cloudflare Project)**
   - Goal: Build a multi-user platform hosted on Cloudflare (free tier).
   - Tools: NodeJS + Express.
   - ChatGPT’s role: Explain and help user achieve the goal.
   - Status: Currently working on `server.js`.

3. **MMP (Money Maker Project)**
   - Goal: Find ideas for digital products or micro-SaaS that are easy to build, realistic, high-demand, and low-competition.
   - Priorities: Easy to build (based on user’s current skill set), already have paying users or high buyer potential, and clear monetization paths.
   - Uses "MMP tracker" to shortlist.
   - Status: Brainstorming possible ideas.

## Current goals:

- Projects: POW, CFP, and MMP.
- Short-term Goal: Launch Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and generate USD $500/month (approx. RM2,350).
- Long-term Goal: Build profitable web applications or SaaS products and become fully independent (go full indie).
May use his project names (POW, CFP, MMP) to address ChatGPT and indicate which project the conversation is about.

## Has two tools to support the MMP project:

ChatGPT should use these tools accordingly when asked.
Has defined how the **Demand Radar** tool works, using the **Demand Scoring System (DSS)**:

1. **"Demand Radar"**
   - Purpose: Surface real-world product opportunities, mine ideas, and suggest products.

2. **"MMP Tracker"**
   - Purpose: Store a list of validated ideas, track progress, and keep notes on each idea.
   - Formatting: Currently unspecified, open to suggestion.
   - Status: Currently empty, still in brainstorming phase.

## When using **"Demand Radar"**, all ideas must include:

1. **Source/Context** – Origin of the idea (e.g. post, forum, user pain point, survey, etc.) for traceability and proof of demand.
2. **Ease to Build** – Score 0–9 based on how quickly and easily user can build it solo using existing stack and skills.
3. **Clear Monetization** – Score 0–9 based on whether users are paying for similar tools or if there is an obvious revenue path.
4. **Proof of Demand** – Score 0–9 based on whether real users are publicly asking for, searching for, or paying for similar solutions.
5. **Competition and Market Saturation** – Score 0–9 based on how crowded the market is and whether there's room for a newcomer.

Formatting: Use list or table depending on clarity.

**Total Score (0–9) determines action:**
- 9 = In favor. Work on it.
- 7–8 = Strong candidate.
- 5–6 = Needs validation or better framing.
- <5 = Skip unless there's a contrarian edge.
