Hi, I’m [@techie-joe](//github.com/techie-joe). 👋

💞️ I really love application development & design (Desktop, Web, Mobile and AI).  
I spend most of my time building - plan, design, writing codes, prompts, and all.  
I'm looking forward to collaborate on any software development projects. 🌱  
Contact me to work together.  💬 [Lets discuss here](//github.com/techie-joe/techie-joe/discussions)
