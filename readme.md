### 👋 Hello there, I'm Joe

🧑‍💻 I'm a **Full-Stack Developer** with 25+ years of experience turning coffee ☕️ into scalable, high-performance software.⚡️  

🖥️ I’ve been building the web since the dial-up era in 1990s. These days, I lead development at **Tidloo Digital**, obsessing over 💞️ clean architecture and leveraging AI to squeeze every bit of efficiency out of the development process.
